# 🧠 Text Assistant for Freelancers

An AI-powered writing assistant designed to help freelancers craft professional proposals, rewrite client messages, and polish their writing — instantly.

## 🚀 Overview
Freelancers often spend time rewriting proposals, emails, and client communications.  
This project uses **FastAPI + OpenAI** to automate that process.

Users can enter a job post or message, and the AI generates:
- A tailored proposal
- A rewritten version (for tone and clarity)
- A concise summary
